          <h2>Hotel Mec Paestum ***** - Paestum, Italy</h2>
          <img src="images/mec-paestum-1.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            We have come to visit this beautiful place which keeps
            record of a huge amount of historical moments, thanks to the
            activity of the archeologists which recovered the ruins of
            an entire roman city, Paestum, which was progressively
            abandoned by its inhabitants.<br> This beautiful and
            flawless hotel is located near the archeological site,
            providing the clients a beautiful sight of the famous
            temples which have inspired also artists of the modern
            times, such as Pink Floyd. <br>Local traditions have
            been influenced also by the Greeks, as well as Spanish,
            since the south of Italy has been ruled by many different
            powers through time. <br>Let yourself being drown into
            history and ancient traditions, enjoying both at the same
            time history and food. <br>This region's traditions
            include thousands of exclusive recipes with local cultivated
            products.
